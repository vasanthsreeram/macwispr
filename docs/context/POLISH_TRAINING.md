# On-device polish model training (MacWispr R&D)

Agent-oriented log of how we train the **local post-STT polish** model: cleanup, lists, course-correction, and **never answering questions** the user is only dictating.

**Status:** Experimental. Not the 1.2.3 shipping line. Worktrees and artifacts live under `~/.cache/macwispr-minicpm-bench/` (Documents sandbox often blocks heavy ML). Product path: `TextPolisher` + optional `PolishModel` bundle.

## Goal

After ASR, rewrite messy spoken text into clean paste-ready text:

| Capability | Example |
|------------|---------|
| Light cleanup | Drop `um` / fix caps — keep meaning |
| Spoken lists | `number one… number two…` → `1.` / `-` / `- [ ]` |
| Course-correction | Keep final intent only (“wait, I mean…”) |
| Preserve questions | `Do you think that's a good idea?` stays a **question**, not `Yes, I think…` |

Polish runs **before** insert at the cursor (not history-only).

## Timeline

### Phase 0 — Liquid / LFM exploration (earlier)

- Sotto-style **LFM2.5-350M** + LoRA course-correction.
- Good for tiny footprint; weak on Flow-like formatting; risk of “stuck on Liquid” UX if defaulted without MiniCPM.
- Kept optional (`PolishModel-LFM`); **not** default.

### Phase 1 — MiniCPM5-1B LoRA (chat checkpoint)

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Base | `mlx-community/MiniCPM5-1B-8bit` (post-trained / chat-style) |
| Method | **LoRA** (`mlx_lm.lora`, rank 16, ~1% trainable) |
| Data | ~1.5k–1.8k synthetic pairs (`### Input` / `### Output`) — template synth + Grok enrichment |
| Result | Strong on simple “Number one is X” lists; **answers questions** (chat prior); hard ordinals weaker |

**Lesson:** LoRA on a **chat** model does not reliably kill “assistant answers the user.”

### Phase 2 — Qwen3.5-0.8B-**Base** full SFT (500 two-pass pairs)

Switch to **base** (pretrain-only), full-weight SFT, and proper data discipline.

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Base | `Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base` → MLX bf16 (`models/Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base-mlx`) |
| Method | `mlx_lm.lora --fine-tune-type full`, 600 iters, LR `5e-6`, max-seq 768 |
| Train data | **500 only** (no legacy MiniCPM merge) |
| Holdout | **500** leak-free eval examples |

#### Two-pass synthetic data (Grok OAuth / Composer 2.5)

| Pass | Temperature | Output |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 — seeds | **High** (~1.15) | Diverse messy `raw` dictations only |
| 2 — labels | **Low** (~0.1) | Perfect `clean` gold only |

**Never** one call for both (temps differ). Batches up to **50 raws**, then **50 cleans**. Auth: OAuth token from `~/.grok/auth.json` → `api.x.ai` (not API-key billing).

Train mix (500): preserve_question heavy, numbered/bullets/checklist/mixed, course, light, preserve_prose.

#### Learning check (stratified 96 / 500 holdout)

| Model | Pass rate | Answer leak | Mean latency |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Untrained Base | **62.5%** | 3.1% | ~1720 ms |
| SFT @ 500 pairs | **85.4%** | **0.0%** | ~700 ms |
| **Delta** | **+22.9 pp** | −3.1 pp | ~2.5× faster |

Per-tag (96-sample):

| Tag | Base | SFT-500 |
|-----|------|---------|
| preserve_question | 67% | **100%** |
| format_numbered | 25% | **75%** |
| format_mixed | 25% | **75%** |
| format_checklist | 42% | **83%** |
| format_bullets | 50% | 58% |
| course | 92% | **100%** |
| preserve_prose | 100% | 100% |
| light | 100%* | 92% |

\*Base “light” often still drafts assistant text but passed a weak heuristic.

**Verdict:** Model **learned**; main gaps = **bullets** and **numbered vs checklist style**.

Artifacts:

- `fused/qwen35-08b-polish-500/`
- `adapters/qwen35-08b-polish-500/`
- `results/learn_test_qwen35_fast.json`

### Phase 3 — Targeted weak-spot practice (~280 → 250 style-OK)

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Data | Two-pass OAuth; focus bullets, numbered-strict, checklist, mixed, light-no-assist |
| Style filter | Prefer gold that matches list markers (e.g. numbered must have `1.` and not `- [ ]`) |
| Continue train | Start from Phase-2 fused weights; **full** SFT, 400 iters, LR `3e-6` |
| Val loss | ~2.10 → ~1.54 |

Targets generated (~280): bullets 70, numbered 70, checklist 45, mixed 35, light 40, numbered-strict 20; **250** passed style checks for train JSONL.

Artifacts:

- `data/qwen35_targeted/`
- `fused/qwen35-08b-polish-targeted/`
- Full **500** holdout eval: `results/eval_full500_targeted.json` (when complete)

---

## Inference contract (app)

```
### Input:
<transcript>

### Output:
```

- Temperature **0** for product polish (deterministic).
- Stop on `### Input:`, `### Output:`, `<think>`.
- Insert **after** polish completes (see `AppState.stopRecordingAndTranscribe`).

## Design principles (do not regress)

1. Prefer **base** over chat/instruct for polish SFT.
2. Prefer **full SFT** (or high-capacity adapters) when killing answer-leak.
3. **Two-pass data:** high-T diversity on raw, low-T correctness on clean.
4. Holdout **≥ hundreds**, leak-free, with explicit **preserve_question**.
5. Measure **pass rate + answer_leak + latency**; not loss alone.
6. Ship defaults: MiniCPM/Liquid optional packs; polish **before** paste.
